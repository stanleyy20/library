My first Full Stack App

I used React, Node.js and PostgreSQL database,
In the pgAdmin application, in the default database named 'postgres', use the Query Tool and paste
the contents of the database.sql file

The next step is to install the dependencies and use commands: 
npm start
npm run dev


We can create two types of users: admin and basic user. 
Admin can add, delete and edit books, while the user can borrow and return books.
There are two views of the book list. Only available books and all books
